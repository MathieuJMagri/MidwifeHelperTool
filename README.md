# MidwifeHelperTool
Designed database model, creation of a schema and implementation and population of a database using DB2 as well as the development of a user-friendly, simple Java application for the database. Project done during the Winter 2022 semester - COMP 421.

Deliverable 1 focuses on the modelling of the database.

For Deliverable 2, the schema is refined, and a database using DB2 is created. We also  write and run some SQL queries. Modifications to the model in Deliverable 1 were also made.

In Deliverable 3, we deploy and implement a java application to be used by the Midwife.
